This work was conducted during my joint PhD at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/ayana/team-members/), d'Université Côte d'Azur and at the [University of Genoa](http://phd-stiet.diten.unige.it/). 
The UAV drone images were acquired by INRAE (Institut National de Recherche pour l'Agriculture, l'Alimentation et l'Environnement), RECOVER, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur research centre, Aix-en-Provence.
The Sentinel-2 mission is part of the European Union Copernicus programme for Earth observations. The images are open access at [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).
